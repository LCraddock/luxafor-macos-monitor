# Outlook Mac Badge Notification Fixes

## Solution 1: Modify Rules to Keep in Inbox
Instead of moving emails, use categories/flags:
- Edit rules to "Mark with category" instead of "Move to folder"
- Emails stay in Inbox (get badges) but are visually organized
- Use Smart Folders to view by category

## Solution 2: Use "Mark as Read" Exception
Add to each rule:
- "Except if marked as important"
- "Except if from [VIP contacts]"
- These exceptions keep important emails in Inbox

## Solution 3: Create "Focused Inbox" Rules
1. Go to Outlook Preferences → Reading → Focused Inbox
2. Configure important senders to go to "Focused"
3. Rules can move "Other" emails but keep "Focused" in Inbox

## Solution 4: Use Conditional Formatting Instead
Rather than moving emails:
1. View → Current View Settings → Conditional Formatting
2. Create rules to color-code emails
3. They stay in Inbox but are visually organized

## Solution 5: AppleScript Workaround
Create a script that monitors all folders:
```applescript
tell application "Microsoft Outlook"
    set unreadCount to 0
    repeat with theFolder in mail folders of default account
        set unreadCount to unreadCount + unread count of theFolder
    end repeat
    return unreadCount
end tell
```

## Solution 6: Third-Party Tools
- **Mail Perspectives**: Shows unified badge count
- **MailHub**: Better notification management
- **Mimestream**: Gmail client with proper badges

## Quick Fix for Testing
For your Luxafor script testing:
1. Temporarily disable one rule
2. Send yourself a test email
3. It will stay in Inbox and create badge
4. Re-enable rule after testing
