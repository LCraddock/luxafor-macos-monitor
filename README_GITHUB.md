## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/luxafor-macos-monitor.git
cd luxafor-macos-monitor

# Run the installer
./install.sh
```

That's it! The monitor is now running and will start automatically on login.

## How It Works

1. Polls notification badges using macOS `lsappinfo` every 5 seconds
2. For Outlook, also checks all folders (not just inbox)
3. Sets Luxafor to the color of the highest priority app with notifications
4. Menu bar icon shows status (üü¢ running / üî¥ stopped)

## Configuration

Edit `~/.luxafor-monitor/luxafor-config.conf` to customize:

```bash
# Format: AppName|BundleID|Color|Priority
Teams|com.microsoft.teams2|red|1
Outlook|com.microsoft.Outlook|blue|2
Slack|com.tinyspeck.slackmacgap|green|3
Zoom|us.zoom.xos|magenta|4
```

After editing, restart via the menu bar or run:
```bash
~/.luxafor-monitor/luxafor-control.sh restart
```

### Finding Bundle IDs

To monitor additional apps:
```bash
lsappinfo list | grep -i "app name"
```

### Available Colors

Basic: `red`, `green`, `blue`, `yellow`, `magenta`, `cyan`, `orange`, `purple`, `pink`, `white`, `off`

Hex: `0xFF00FF` or `#FF00FF`

## Requirements

- macOS 10.15 or later

## Menu Bar Features

## Command Line Usage

## Troubleshooting

**Luxafor not lighting up?**
- Check if monitoring is running (menu bar should show üü¢)
- Ensure apps have badge notifications enabled in System Settings
- Test LED directly: `~/.luxafor-monitor/luxafor-cli/build/luxafor red`

**Apps not detected?**
- Apps must be in the Dock
- For Teams: @mention yourself in a channel
- For Slack: Use `/remind me test in 1 minute`
